# budget-tracker

This is a simple application that allows the user to add and track spending items to manage their budget. As the user enters in spend items, the budget tracker will add it to the list and update the graph below. This is a great tool for keeping track of how spending is coming in against a person's budget, whether on travel, a home project, or a new business venture.

The best part is that this application functions both online and offline!
